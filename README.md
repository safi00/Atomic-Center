Would recomend checking the Github Projects link: [-insert link to github project-](https://github.com/users/safi00/projects/3) \
Or the Github Issues: https://github.com/safi00/Terra/issues \
Both show progress but i detail more in Github Issues!

I’m going to be making a digital version of Atomic Center (the board game I made last blok).
It’s going to be 3d and is currently undecided if I can do multiple levels or just one level.

Atomic Center can be played by 2-5 players, turn order is decided at the start of the game by rolling dice to see who rolls higher. 
Turn order is decided by highest to lowest. The game can be played alone but some dynamic mechanics would not be as harsh. 
The player uses 2 D6 dices to move around the board. As the player moves and lands on different tiles it has different prompts.
You are not allowed to walk backwards; each time you pass the start you get a point. \

The current tiles are: \
•	If you land on a white tile then you get a hint, with that hint you can try and guess the element. If you don’t guess the element, you can stay there the next turn for another hint or move to another tile to guess another element.\
•	If you land on a purple tile, then you get an opportunity to answer a chemistry question for a 2 points. You answer wrong you lose a point. \
•	If you land on a red tile, everybody on the board must give their hand to the person on their left.\
•	If you land on a blue tile, then you get to grab a card from the middle.
it’s going to be a random event, that ranges from good to bad. \

I’m looking to add more Dynamic interactions to it, The game is already pretty strong in educational elements by adding guesses and questions whenever the player lands on certain tiles.\
By giving the player points and a “power-up” should help but i shouldnt make it too drastic but i'll have to see balance wise. The game doesn’t necessarily needs you to have ALOT prior knowledge of chemistry, but atleat some. One of the early ideas is to have the player get a ui at the start of their turn with move/power-up/view map/stay.
Having a camera all the way above the map for a mini map.\

The goal is to either get a is to get the most points. The game ends when the win condition is met, either the turn limit is reached (10/25/50/∞/Custom) or the point (10/25/50/∞/Custom). Could have one or both.\

For powerup ideas I have that: \
•	Bonus D6 die.\
•	Bonus D10 die.\
•	Steal a Die from a player.\
•	teleport to a player.\
